Watching Game of Thrones I haven't left home,
Told everyone that I had the flu
It's an obsession I'm filled with depression
cus it's the end of season two
Now, my, friends all tell me
That I've lost my grip on reality
They tell me it's just a nerd show,
But Dragons are real to me
Some day those dragons will be grown
Daenerys will be my queen
and when we reclaim the throne
